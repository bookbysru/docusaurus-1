The goal of the OPQ Box Update Server is to provide an HTTP endpoint that hosts updates for OPQBoxes.

The server consists of a single Python file and does not depend on any external dependencies.

The source for the server can be found at [https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq/tree/master/box-update-server](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq/tree/master/box-update-server).
